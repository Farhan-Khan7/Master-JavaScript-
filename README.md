## 📘 JavaScript Learning Roadmap (Chapter-wise Overview)

This repository follows a **structured chapter-by-chapter approach** to master JavaScript fundamentals.
Each chapter focuses on concepts, real-world understanding, and hands-on practice.

---

## 📦 Chapter 1: Variables & Declarations ✅

This chapter builds the **foundation of JavaScript**.

**What I learned:**
- What variables are and how JavaScript stores data in memory
- Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Block scope vs function scope
- Hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
- Why `const` is preferred in modern JavaScript

**Outcome:**  
I can now safely declare variables, understand scope-related bugs, and write cleaner code.

## 🧠 Chapter 2: Data Types & Type System ⏳

This chapter explains **what kind of data JavaScript works with**.

**What I’m learning:**
- Primitive data types (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt)
- Reference data types (Object, Array, Function)
- Difference between `null` and `undefined`
- `typeof` operator and its edge cases
- Type coercion (automatic type conversion)
- Truthy and falsy values
- Loose (`==`) vs strict (`===`) comparison

**Outcome:**  
I understand how JavaScript treats data internally and how type conversion can affect logic.

---

## 🔢 Chapter 3: Operators 🔒

This chapter focuses on **how operations and expressions work**.

**What this chapter covers:**
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`)
- Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Unary operators and type conversion
- Ternary (conditional) operator

**Outcome:**  
I can write conditions, comparisons, and expressions confidently without unexpected results.

---

## 🚦 Chapter 4: Control Flow 🔒

This chapter teaches **decision-making in JavaScript**.

**What I’ll learn:**
- `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
- `switch-case` for multiple conditions
- Early return pattern to avoid deep nesting
- Writing readable and maintainable conditional logic
- Using truthy and falsy values in conditions

**Outcome:**  
I can control how and when different parts of code execute based on conditions.

---

## 🔁 Chapter 5: Loops 🔒

This chapter explains **how to repeat tasks efficiently**.

**Concepts covered:**
- `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- `break` and `continue`
- `for-of` for arrays and strings
- `for-in` for objects
- `forEach` for array iteration
- Choosing the right loop for the right scenario

**Outcome:**  
I can process lists of data, repeat logic efficiently, and avoid unnecessary code repetition.

---

## 🧮 Chapter 6: Functions 🔒

This chapter dives into **reusable logic and program structure**.

**What I’ll learn:**
- Function declarations and expressions
- Parameters vs arguments
- Return values
- Arrow functions
- Default, rest, and spread parameters
- Higher-order functions
- Closures and lexical scope
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- Hoisting differences between declarations and expressions

**Outcome:**  
I can write reusable, clean, and modular JavaScript code.

---

## 📚 Chapter 7: Arrays 🔒

This chapter focuses on **working with collections of data**.

**Topics included:**
- Creating and accessing arrays
- Modifying arrays (push, pop, shift, splice)
- Non-mutating methods (slice, map, filter)
- Iteration methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`)
- Searching methods (`find`, `some`, `every`)
- Array destructuring
- Spread operator
- Sorting correctly in JavaScript

**Outcome:**  
I can transform, filter, and analyze data using arrays effectively.

---

## 🧱 Chapter 8: Objects 🔒

This chapter covers **structured and real-world data modeling**.

**What I’ll learn:**
- Object creation and key-value structure
- Dot vs bracket notation
- Nested objects and deep access
- Object destructuring
- Looping through objects
- Shallow vs deep copy
- Spread operator and `Object.assign`
- Optional chaining
- Computed properties

**Outcome:**  
I can represent complex data like users, products, and configurations using objects.
